## Research Notes

Notes on papers that I've read. Papers are roughly organized into categories, and each paper has its own folder. I have a handy-dandy VSCode extension called [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) that saves all the Markdown (with Latex) to an HTML file. 

ðŸš¨ **N.B.** The notes on these papers do not reflect my views or those of the authors! Just jotting down my own summaries for my reference.
