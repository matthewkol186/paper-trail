## Research Notes

Notes on papers that I've read. Papers are roughly organized into categories, and each paper has its own folder. I have a handy-dandy VSCode extension called [Markdown+Math](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=goessner.mdmath) that saves all the Markdown (with Latex) to an HTML file. 

ðŸš¨ **N.B.** The notes on these papers do not reflect my views or those of the authors! Just jotting down my own summaries for my reference.

ðŸ“œ If you'd like to read the nicely-formatted HTML versions of any of these notes, you can navigate to any of the files called `notes.html` and then prepend the URL with `https://htmlpreview.github.io/?` and hit enter. See below:
